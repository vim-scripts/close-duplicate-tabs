Vim Plugin for closing duplicate tabs

When using tab pages, this plugin can help you close tabs
with the same file that might have accidentaly opened while
editting in a rush.

I wrote this because sometimes I open the same file in several
tabs, so it may get a little messy and this helps me clean it up.

I am not very familiar with Vimscript and I know there might be
better ways to write some things from this little script. I am
open to suggestions.
